# Rock Paper Scissors Game - Python (Terminal-Based)

A terminal-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python. This project highlights the use of **functions**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and standard Python modules for a clean and maintainable design.

## Features
- **Terminal-Based Interaction**: Simple and intuitive text-based gameplay through the terminal.
- **OOP Design**: Modular structure using classes for better organization and scalability.
- **Randomized Computer Moves**: Computer selects its move randomly using the `random` module.
- **Replay Option**: Play multiple rounds with the option to continue or exit after each game.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Built-in Modules**: `random`, `time`

## Getting Started

### Run the Game
```bash
python game.py
